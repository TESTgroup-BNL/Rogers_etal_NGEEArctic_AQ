# Rogers_etal_NGEEArctic_LightResponse
R scripts for fitting photosynthetic light response curves and inverting leaf reflectance observations with the PROSPECT-5 leaf radiative transfer model (RTM).  These scripts were used in the development of: <br>

Rogers, A., Serbin, S.P., Ely, K.S. and Wullschleger, S.D. (2019), Terrestrial biosphere models may overestimate Arctic CO2 assimilation if they do not account for decreased quantum yield and convexity at low temperature. New Phytol, 223: 167-179. https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15750

## Contains:
Compiled LiCor light response curve measurements and scripts for fitting light response curve data and for calculating leaf absorptance from measurements of leaf reflectance
